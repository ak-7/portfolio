            Hi folks,

            I have over 6 years of industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer and Tech Lead, working on
            cutting-edge and
            impactful problems in large language models, multimodal machine learning, information retrieval, and natural
            language
            processing. Currently, I am a Machine Learning TL at LinkedIn, where I build large personalized machine
            learning models
            for the Feed AI team, applying my expertise in generative AI, online and offline ML, representation
            learning, and NLP
            techniques.

            In my previous roles at Facebook and Apple, I contributed to cross-platform ML on Instagram and other family
            of apps,
            and multimodal and NLP R&D for Siri Natural Language, respectively. I also demonstrated and presented my
            work at various
            internal and external events, such as the Apple ML Summit, the Natural Language Understanding workshop, and
            the ICASSP
            conference. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I
            studied machine
            learning and interactive intelligent systems, and worked on computer vision and optimization problems in the
            Robotics
            Lab. I have published patents and papers at ICASSP, International Journal of Computer Applications, and
            obtained
            multiple certifications from Coursera and NVIDIA. I am also a Tata Scholar, a K C Mahindra Scholar, and a
            Stanford
            Summer School attendee.

            I am passionate about solving challenging and impactful problems using machine learning and artificial
            intelligence, and
            I am always eager to learn new techniques and tools to enhance my expertise and performance. I enjoy working
            with
            talented and diverse teams, and I value collaboration, innovation, and excellence. If your interests align
            with mine, I
            would love to talk to you, please reach out to me at akanksha.bindal@gmail.com.

            When i'm not building models, you'll find me enjoying sci-fi movies / books, being a fitness junkie or on a
            coffee run.
