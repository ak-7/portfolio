Hi folks, 

I have over 6 years of industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer and Tech Lead, working on cutting-edge and impactful problems in large language models, multimodal machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. Currently, I am a Machine Learning TL at LinkedIn, where I build large personalized machine learning models for the Feed AI team, applying my expertise in generative AI, online and offline ML, representation learning, and NLP techniques.

In my previous roles at Facebook and Apple, I contributed to cross-platform ML on Instagram and other family of apps, and multimodal and NLP R&D for Siri Natural Language, respectively. I also demonstrated and presented my work at various internal and external events, such as the Apple ML Summit, the Natural Language Understanding workshop, and the ICASSP conference. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I studied machine learning and interactive intelligent systems, and worked on computer vision and optimization problems in the Robotics Lab. I have published patents and papers at ICASSP, International Journal of Computer Applications, and obtained multiple certifications from Coursera and NVIDIA. I am also a Tata Scholar, a K C Mahindra Scholar, and a Stanford Summer School attendee. 

I am passionate about solving challenging and impactful problems using machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I am always eager to learn new techniques and tools to enhance my expertise and performance. I enjoy working with talented and diverse teams, and I value collaboration, innovation, and excellence. If your interests align with mine, I would love to talk to you, please reach out to me at akanksha.bindal@gmail.com.

When i'm not building models, you'll find me enjoying sci-fi movies / books, being a fitness junkie or on a coffee run.
